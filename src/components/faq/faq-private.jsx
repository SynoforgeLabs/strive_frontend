                                You will never be charged before a session is completed. For the first lesson with your tutor, you will receive an invoice. Please ensure that this invoice is paid within 48 hours.

                                Lessons run exactly how you would like them to run, and as agreed upon in the 30-minute free academic consultation. Sessions can be run in a curriculum based style where the tutor helps you understand content, or they can be a Q&A style. We also believe that assignment drafting is an opportunity to learn so must be done within a lesson.
