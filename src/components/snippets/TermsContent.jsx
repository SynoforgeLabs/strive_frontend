      <h2 className="terms-section-title mt-5">Appendices</h2>
      
      <h3 className="terms-section-subtitle">Appendix A – Payment Policy</h3>
      <ol className="terms-appendix-list">
        <li>The "30-minutes free academic consultation" does not incur any fee. In all lessons thereafter, we will only collect lesson payments after a lesson has been completed.</li>
        <li>The first lesson with a Tutor will be charged as an invoice, sent to the Student's chosen email address.</li>
        <li>This invoice must be paid within 3 days after being issued via Credit Card or Direct Debit methods.</li>
        <li>In the future sessions, charges will be processed automatically through our payment platform. Following the completion of a lesson and the Tutor's confirmation on our system, payment will be automatically deducted from the Student's designated payment method one hour later.</li>
        <li>After any payment, invoice or automatic charge, a receipt will be sent to the Student via email.</li>
        <li>All payments are due within 3 days. Within this specified timeframe, students are required to submit payment. Failure to fulfil this obligation may lead to tutors suspending future lessons until the outstanding payment is settled.</li>
        <li>Failure to pay an invoice for 14 days will result in a $30 late fee that will be charged against the Student in addition to any outstanding payments.</li>
        <li>Failure to pay within 28 days will result in the Student's account and details being forwarded on to Marshall Freeman Debt Collections (or another debt recovery agency) for recovery.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3 className="terms-section-subtitle">Appendix B – Cancellation Policy</h3>
      <ol className="terms-appendix-list">
        <li>Once a lesson (either through in-person or online means) has been arranged, we, acting as the agent of the Tutor, considers this booking to be final (and subject to advertised fees), subject to this Cancellation Policy. Note that if a lesson is cancelled for any reason, the Student must notify the Tutor immediately.</li>
        <li>If the reason for cancellation is not acceptable or the lesson is cancelled by the Student with less than 24 hours notice, a cancellation fee of 50% of the planned lesson fee shall be charged. For Tutors to process a missed lesson (without sufficient notice given), they must firstly contact us to notify us of the cancellation.</li>
        <li>What is an arranged lesson?
          <ol type="a">
            <li>An arranged lesson is one which the student and tutor have agreed to hold at a particular time and place (either in-person or online). The agreement can be verbal or written. A lesson will be considered to have been arranged even if the Tutor or Student knew or ought to have known at the time of arrangement that the lesson would have to be cancelled. If an agreement is reached to continue holding lessons regularly for a period of time, it will be considered that lessons have been arranged, even if specific times and places have not been agreed.</li>
            <li>If the Student and Tutor arrange to have a lesson subject to any conditions other than those listed in this document, the lesson will not be considered to have been arranged as long as any of the conditions are not met. However, as soon as all conditions are met, the lesson will be considered to have been arranged.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Acceptable reasons for cancellation
          <p>The Student must not be charged for the lesson if the lesson is cancelled more than 1 hour before commencement solely due to:</p>

              <li>unable to be rescheduled;</li>
            </ol>
            <li>the Student and the Tutor agreeing to cancel the lesson without charge;</li>
            <li>the Student's requirement to appear in court for any reason;</li>
            <li>the Student cancelling the lesson with sufficient notice; or</li>
            <li>any other unforeseeable event which should reasonably take precedence over the Student's attendance at the lesson.</li>
